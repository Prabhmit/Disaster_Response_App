# Installations and package requirement

The code is in Python 3.7.6. The ETL Pipeline Preparation and ML Pipeline Preparation are Jupyter notebooks. The process_data.py, train_classifier.py and run.py are python scripts.The Python libraries applied are sys, nltk, sqlite3, numpy, pandas, pickle sqlachemy and sklearn. 

# Project Motivation

The primary motivations are to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a machine learning model for an API that classifies disaster messages for appropriate disaster relief agency. The project also includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays data visualizations. 

# Project Components and File Descriptions

The datasets are messages.csv and categories.csv. The ETL Pipeline Preparation and ML Pipeline Preparation are Jupyter notebooks used to construct data cleaning and machine learning pipelines

The project has three components: 

## 1. ETL Pipeline

## 2. ML Pipeline

## 3. Flask Web App
